# Bot-or-Not
This repository contains three different methods for detecting twitter bot accounts. Each directory corresponds to a different method. The `data-exploration` directory contains code for exploring the TwiBot-20 dataset, which is the dataset we use to train all our models. 

A detailed blog post explaining our work can be found [here](https://psinha25.github.io/2022-12-05-twitter-bot-detection/).
